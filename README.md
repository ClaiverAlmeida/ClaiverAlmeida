ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ClaiverAlmeida
Software Developer, with experience in acting in some projects for clients from different segments.
Starting in development in January 2021, I recognize myself as an enthusiast in new technologies in the market, with learning acquired day by day.

I am focused on developing with Javascript, TypeScript, Angular, NodeJS and currently in .NET among other technologies that I use to create web applications.

I consider myself agile and consistent in learning a new technology and highly adaptable to changes, ready to overcome any challenge!
